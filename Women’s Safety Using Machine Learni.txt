Women’s Safety Using Machine Learning

Overview

Women’s safety remains a pressing concern in today’s rapidly urbanizing world, where unpredictable environments and delayed responses can lead to critical consequences.
This project introduces a Machine Learning–based safety system that intelligently classifies human activity using sensor data and initiates real-time alerts in potentially dangerous situations.

By leveraging the UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset, the system learns to recognize patterns from accelerometer and gyroscope readings and detect abnormal or risky behaviors. When a threat is identified, it automatically triggers a geo-location–based emergency alert to predefined contacts.

This project focuses on enhancing women’s safety using machine learning by developing an intelligent system capable of detecting risky or abnormal human activities through sensor data analysis. In today’s fast-moving and unpredictable urban environments, relying solely on manual safety triggers or fixed-threshold systems can delay emergency responses. To overcome these limitations, the proposed system utilizes the UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset, which contains accelerometer and gyroscope readings from smartphones worn by users performing various activities. Using this data, multiple machine learning models—Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)—were trained to classify human behavior patterns accurately. A Voting Ensemble model was then constructed to combine these classifiers and improve prediction reliability. The system intelligently identifies high-risk movements, such as sudden falls or unusual motions, and automatically initiates a simulated emergency response by sending an alert message along with the user’s real-time location to predefined contacts. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix metrics, with the ensemble model outperforming the individual classifiers. This project not only demonstrates the potential of integrating machine learning with wearable or smartphone sensors for safety applications but also highlights a practical step toward real-time, automated emergency alert systems that can significantly improve response times and personal security in critical situations.
